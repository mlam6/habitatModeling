GIT 101
___________________________________
Git is a version control system which allows us keep the history of our repository. 
Which is great becuase at anytime our code breaks we can always revert it back to an older version. 
Git also allows you to back up your code and work collaboratively.  

**Please see below to see how it works!**


Git - The Command Line
____________________________________
**CLONE REPOSITORY**
git clone https://github.com/mlam6/habitatModeling.git

**CREATE YOUR BRANCH**
git checkout -b nameOfYourBranch 
ex. git checkout -b Michelle 


**COMIITING FILES TO GITHUB**
git status                                           # check state of your repository
git pull                                             # pull latest commits form github
git add -A                                           # add files before commiting them
git commit -m "Message about what you have done"     # commits changes to branch 
git push origin nameOfYourBranch                     # push changes to github
git branch                                           # checks which branch your are currently on
git status                                           # checks status of branch
 

 
Git - GUI interface
___________________________________
If you're not comfortatble with the command line you can opt into the option of a GUI. 
This can be downloaded from here-- https://desktop.github.com/
This works very similarily,
    1. You'll first have to log into your github account
    2. Goto file> clone repositoty > URL > 
       enter https://github.com/mlam6/habitatModeling.git for repository URL
       and choose a local path > clone
    3. Click Fetch origin on the top of the window to ensure your repository is up-to-date
       with the repository
    4. Whenever you make any changes to your scripts they will automatically show up here
       RED denotes deleted 
       GREEN denotes added 
    5. To commit, there is a blue button on the bottom left hand side.
       Add a summary and description of the changes you have made.
       before committing double check on the top of the window that you are on the correct
       branch then click on the 'Commit to ...'

**That should be enough to get you started! But of course if you have any question feel free to ask me :) **
